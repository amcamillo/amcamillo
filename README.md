I'm passionate about Networks, Cloud and InfoSec. 
A geek at heart who loves to play with tech and the piano despite not being good at either.
I guess you can call me a rebel (or just someone that is constantly learning) then.

- 🦾 I’m looking to collaborate on Azure and Cybersecurity-related automation codes (BICEP)
- 💬 Ask me about Career, Cloud, Infosec (and Music)
