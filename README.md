### Hi there 👋 I'm Andre Camillo

<!--
**amcamillo/amcamillo** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I'm passionate about securing people in the digital world and its many assets. 
A geek at heart who loves to play with tech and the piano despite not being good at either.
I guess you can call me a rebel (or just someone that is constantly learning) then.

- CISSP, Certified CrowdStrike Falcon Administrator, Microsoft Security Architect, Security Analyst, AZ-900, etc etc...
- ⚒️ I work with Solution Development, Cloud Security & Compliance
