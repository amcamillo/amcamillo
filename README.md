### Hi there 👋 I'm Andre Camillo

<!--
**amcamillo/amcamillo** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I'm passionate about Networks, Cloud and InfoSec. 
A geek at heart who loves to play with tech and the piano despite not being good at either.
I guess you can call me a rebel (or just someone that is constantly learning) then.

- CISSP, Certified Microsoft Security Architect, Security Analyst, AZ-900, etc etc...
- ⚒️ I work with Cloud Security & Compliance.
